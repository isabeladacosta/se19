Website for SE_19 assessment.

///////Context

For this project I wanted to build a website that is like a portolio so I could use it myself in the future to showcase my projects.

First I took an image of a layout i've seen on pinterest as reference then I started to code it and bring it to real life. It took me a couple of weeks to get to this point you are currently seeing. This website contains a log-in system, contact form, and it's connected to Firebase where I'm storing the content data of the contact form and the posts on the 'create' page. Aside the Navbar, this website also looks pretty good on mobile view. 

To build this website I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I had the help of online courses and the W3Schools page. The purpose of this website is also to showcase my skills with web development. Therefore I use different methods to solve problems.

This website is not live because it's not ready yet. There are still a couple of otimizations and customizations that I would like to do before calling it "100% ready".




//////Navigation

1. To open the website please click on the 'index.html' document.
2. The navbar links such as: home, about, projects and contact takes the user to different sections of the page.
3. On the section 'About', when then button 'More...' is clicked, it reveals another part of the filler text and the button is hidden.
4. On the 'Contact' section the user can fill the form. When clicking the button 'Send' the message is saved on a collection inside firebase. 
5. Back to the navbar on the top of the page, when the link 'Log In' is clicked a pop up appers on the screen.
6. The values are already set inside the login pop up, just click the button 'Log In' and the user will be logged in automatically.
7. When logged in, the link 'Create Project' appears in te navbar. This links directs the user to another page.
8. Inside the 'Create' page a collection of cards is seen. This collection is saved on Firebase and being displayed on the page.
9. On the bottom of the page the user can create a new card by filling the form and hitting the button 'Send'. This saves the new card into Firebase and reloads the page. Example values are already in the form. 
10. When the user goes back to the Home page, it can log out by clicking the 'Log Out' button.
